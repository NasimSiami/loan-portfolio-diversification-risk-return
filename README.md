**Author:** Nasim Siami  
**Project:** FINA62018A – Risk Management (HEC Montréal)  
**Advisor:** Dr. M. Mnasri  
**Date:** Fall 2022  

## 📌 Project Summary

This research investigates whether **loan portfolio diversification leads to improved risk and return outcomes for banks**. The project evaluates three major empirical papers that offer contrasting views on the subject, focusing on banks from Germany, Austria, and dual-banking systems (Islamic and conventional).

The study explores:

- The **modern portfolio theory vs. corporate finance theory** debate on diversification
- The role of **sectoral diversification** in managing credit risk and improving efficiency
- Real-world implications for **risk management practices** and **Basel III** compliance

## 📚 Papers Analyzed

1. **Jahn et al. (2013):** Sectoral concentration in German banks and its effect on loan losses.
2. **Seho et al. (2021):** Sectoral diversification in Islamic and conventional banks.
3. **Rossi et al. (2009):** Diversification and managerial behavior in Austrian banks.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Mixed evidence: Diversification lowers risk in some cases but increases volatility and inefficiency in others.
- Monitoring benefits: Banks concentrating in specific sectors tend to manage credit risk more effectively.
- Stress Testing Gap: None of the papers fully account for tail-risk or extreme event scenarios (e.g., 2008 financial crisis).
- Suggested improvements: Incorporate **CVaR**, backtesting, and better sample selection for robustness.

## 💡 Conclusion

The analysis suggests that while diversification generally reduces risk, the **degree and method** of diversification matter significantly. Policy and risk modeling improvements are needed to fully capture the impact of diversification under stress.
